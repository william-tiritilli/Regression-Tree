# Explanation
The Classification And Regression Tree algorithm, aka CART, (Breiman, 1984) works by partintioning the feature space into a number of smaller (non-overlapping) regions with similar response values usint a set of splitting rules.
The goal is at each threshold, the minimum sum squared of residuals between the observed value and the predicted value is minimal.
